# RoCraft
## Description
This is a club project to add something that our devs mess with it. It's a reletively small type of project that can turn into a major project for everyone.
Here are our reasons why we use Replit instead of using VS Code as our main software:
	1. Easy to access for Chromebooks
	2. Cannot be block by our school district
	3. Online
	4. No hassel of download VS Code from another website
	5. Easy for research from other apps as well
## Goals
There are many goals to our devs because we need to research and experiment our apps and games to use our own darknet protocal for more secure gaming. These are our part of the goals:
	1. Realistic terrain generation
	2. Backward capability
	3. Client support
	4. Virtualized custom OS
	5. Own custom secret software(we cannot reveal this because our devs are working on this)
